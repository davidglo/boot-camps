## Hints and tips

[Hints and tips](HintsAndTips.md) on common Bash and editor commands.

Beginners guide to using the [shell](shell/README.md)
## Before you arrive...

You should have your own laptop to work on (so that you can easily continue to use the same tools for the hackathon!).

You will also need to create a free individual account on 
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/). Make sure 
you know your username and password when you arrive

We recommend that you to work through this short tutorial on 
[Beginning Python](http://chryswoods.com/beginning_python) to refresh yourself on Python.
